# The Centre Registry
The Centre Registry is a Django web application and service that serves as administrative registry for CLARIN, documented on [the CLARIN Trac](https://trac.clarin.eu/wiki/Centre%20Registry).

## REST API
`api/KML/`
Gives a KML file (Keyhole Markup) with geographical information about all Centres, for use in
mapping applications.

`api/KML/[N[N[N[N[N[N]]]]]`.
Gives a KML file (Keyhole Markup) with geographical information about Centres of any type N, for
use in mapping applications. For example: `api/KML/EBC`

`api/model/M`, where M is one of the models in the administration interface `CentreType`,
`Centre`, `Contact`, `Consortium`, `FCSEndpoint`, `URLReference`, `MetadataFormat`,
`OAIPMHEndpoint`, `SAMLIdentityFederation`, `SAMLServiceProvider`:
Gives a JSON representation of all data belonging to that model in the database.

## Development
### Make migrations
Django wants to detect modifications made to the data model of apps:
```sh
'Centre-Registry-config/manage.py' makemigrations
```
When you change an existing field, be careful to only change one property per `makemigrations` run (e.g, first change the field identifier, then the  `verbose_name` string).

### Show migrations
To show migrations previously made, and whether they have been carried out or not:
```sh
'Centre-Registry-config/manage.py' showmigrations
```
### Generate fixtures
For testing, you will need a sample of the data that obeys the data model. To generate such a *fixture*, run this:
```sh
'Centre-Registry-config/manage.py' dumpdata \
    --format=json --indent 4 \
    --natural-primary --natural-foreign \
    --exclude=auth --exclude=sessions --exclude=admin --exclude=contenttypes \
    --no-color --traceback -o \
    'centre-registry-app/centre_registry/fixtures/test_data.json'
```
When you change an existing field of some class in your data model, be careful to make only this single change per `makemigrations` run (e.g, first change the field identifier, then the  `verbose_name` value), otherwise `makemigrations` will go awry.

### Migrate
After making migrations, you will still need to apply them:
```sh
'Centre-Registry-config/manage.py' migrate
```
**Always generate new a fixture after migrating.** If you do not, your fixture will not correspond to the actual data model, and testing runs will fail outright.

### Test
#### From an IDE
Within your IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, your project should have a Django 'facet' detected automatically. If so, you should have the complete testing 'run configuration' available.
#### From the command line
First make sure that `centre-registry-app` and `Centre-Registry-config` are installed. Then run the test modules `centre_registry.test_api` and `centre_registry.test_ui` like so:
```sh
'Centre-Registry-config/manage.py' test centre_registry
```
Or more selectively:
```sh
'Centre-Registry-config/manage.py' test centre_registry.{test_api,test_ui}
```
