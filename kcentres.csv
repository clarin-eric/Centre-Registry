Besides responding to questions on these topics, it also provides informative material and documentation relevant to these issues; this material includes (but is not limited to) (i) scientific publications and presentations on Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and applications for Greek and Greek sign language, (ii) guides and tutorials on language processing tools and services for Greek and Greek sign language, (iii) direct connection to the specialized Sign Language Technologies website and (iv) direct connection to the CLARIN:EL infrastructure, where the users can find a catalogue of digital language resources and language processing tools, more detailed information and further training and dissemination material."#"Computational linguists;

For data storage and access the centre collaborates with MPI's TLA (The Language Archive) which is a CLARIN B Centre and also based in Nijmegen.
